# The Engula Community Project

## Preamble

The Engula Community Project plans to build the Engula community, i.e., make the Engula community a world-class open-source infrastructure software community.

## Positioning

The [Engula](https://github.com/engula/engula) project aims to provide fundamental building blocks for developers of data processing software such as databases and a robust infrastructure software ecosystem that can be built by collaborating with various developers.

Commercial companies can invest in developing the Engula project to increase their technical presence in the field, build their brand and recruit talent, and plan to build their business value based on the Engula project.

Regarding positioning, the Engula project is a neutral open-source software project, and commercial companies' investment in the Engula project for the above-mentioned corporate goals can be considered as sponsorship of the Engula project.

In order to build a robust infrastructure ecosystem for the Engula project, it is essential to focus on a diverse group of potential contributors. At the moment, it is worthwhile to pay attention to talented developers in the Rust community, developers who build data processing software such as databases, and senior developers in the storage engine field.

From a commercial company's point of view, to ensure that the company gets technical influence, branding, and the technical advantage of creating value from participating and sponsoring projects, it needs to invest in R&D full participation to gain a corresponding community voice.

## Participation

### Create a valuable project

Follow software engineering best practices, ensure open communication and release regularly.

Reference: [Project Management Discussion in Engula](https://github.com/engula/engula/discussions/32)

A solid technical core (team) that produces technical values and design documentation.

A solid opinion leader (group) to clarify project goals and inspires participation, bringing together experts and enthusiasts in related fields.

### Community of Peers

The Engula's flat structure dictates that roles are equal irrespective of title, votes hold equal weight, and contributions are made on a volunteer basis (even if paid to work on Engula code).

Equality is not equalitarianism, it is based on contribution to earn authority.

> **Earned Authority**: all individuals are given the opportunity to participate, but their influence is based on publicly earned merit – what they contribute to the community. Merit lies with the individual, does not expire, is not influenced by employment status or employer, and is non-transferable (merit earned in one project cannot be applied to another). [More on merit](https://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html#meritocracy).

Reference: [The Apache Way](https://www.apache.org/theapacheway/index.html)

We don't assign tasks to others. It is possible to suggest someone take over a task, but the actual action is up to the corresponding member to assign themselves or request assigning themselves by comment. This is also a community value influence, where community members are driven by volition and enthusiasm rather than top-down assignments.

### Avoid private discussions

Private discussions raise the cost of communication throughout the community.

The Engula community suggests to discussion with:

* GitHub, as the single source of truth for technical topics;
* Discord, as an auxiliary communication tool;
* Other additional communication tools that don't produce truth.

Emphasize communication, and more importantly, a hierarchy of communication. For example, decisions in the community have a single source, such as the ASF mailing list, Rust's RFC processes, and so on.

For example, suppose several contributors propose a draft design. In that case, they will publish the proposal on the mailing list or discussion forum. If the content is not straightforward, the participants will continue the discussion with instant messaging for quick synchronization and then call or meet in person.

In this way, it is gradually narrowed down from a large scope to a small scope, synchronizing information on a large scale and resolving conflicts on a small scale. Instead of from small scope to large scope, only a few people know the tribal knowledge. The other people can only rely on guessing or highly inefficient multiple small scopes repeatedly synchronized.

### Activities and events

The main goal of the Engula project at the moment is to complete the prototype and release v0.2. Therefore, we do not need to prepare for events intentionally. However, there are still some potential activities or events opportunities.

1. Keep posting the progress of the Engula project and reflect the contributor's contribution on Twitter.
2. After we finish the prototype development, we can ask the maintainers to host a webinar to share the project design.

The purpose of events is not about the number of clicks or participants but about keeping the communication and information exchanging smoothly in the Engula project community.

### Practice the code of conduct

Please read the Engula Code of Conduct, which is adapted from the Rust Code of Conduct as well as the Citizen Code of Conduct. We chose this code of conduct, and it should really be practiced in the community.

Reference: [The Engula Code of Conduct](https://github.com/engula/engula/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## Measuring

One of the benefits of measuring is that the Engula project goes through initiation to incubation. We can explore the appropriate metrics to measure the metrics' feedback to the community regarding perceptual and rational value. We will do reports on the project to communicate what we know about the community in an easy-to-understand format to each individual who cares about the Engula community.

When we released Engula v1.0, we graduated from this incubation program. Therefore, we can continue to measure the valuable metrics and pose higher challenges to achieve the goals or explore the appropriate focus in new situations.

More importantly, the incubating process will become a proven set of best practices for the Engula community. One of our goals is to integrate Engula into the broader storage/computing ecosystem. This incubation mechanism can be naturally applied to projects in the Engula community, guiding them to success, helping them to develop great software, running the community wisely, and attracting developers and users.

### Qualitative measurement

We're now focusing on quality, releases, and community according to The Apache Project Maturity Model.

Reference: [The Apache Project Maturity Model](https://community.apache.org/apache-way/apache-project-maturity-model.html)

### Quantitative measurement

We're now measuring with [orbit.love](https://orbit.love/) solution. There is no need to define clear quantitative metrics at the moment, as the numbers of each metric are relatively small, and we can take into account the variation of most quantitative metrics. Nevertheless, this source of data analysis can provide some insight from which to select, combine, or secondarily develop quantitative metrics of interest.

## Future

In the long run, we may construct a foundation for operating Engula with a neutral organization, which is more conducive to the participation of multiple parties in the ecosystem.

## Appendix: Community Report

Engula is a storage engine that empowers engineers to build reliable and cost-effective databases with less effort and more confidence.

Engula has been open-source developing since 2021-08-05.

**Three most important unfinished issues to address before next demo/release**:

1. [Implement basic abstractions](https://github.com/engula/engula/issues/57).
2. [Initialize release processes](https://github.com/engula/engula/discussions/32).
3. Continuously attract contributors to build a diverse community.

**Are there any issues that users or contributors need to be aware of?**

No. Engula is under rapidly formal development, and it's enough to catch up with any activity one is interested in.

**How has the community developed since the last report?**

1. Create a [Discord server](https://discord.gg/AN6vgVXaHC) and grow more than 20 members.
2. Host the project website on http://engula.io/.
3. Increase more than five active contributors.
4. Write down The Engula Code of Conduct and contributing guide.

**How has the project developed since the last report?**

1. Finish [demo-1](https://engula.io/posts/demo-1/).
2. Write down [design documents](https://github.com/engula/engula/tree/main/docs).
3. Implement several basic abstractions: microunit, storage, background, and data API.
4. Set up ci pipelines.

**How would you assess the project maturity?**
